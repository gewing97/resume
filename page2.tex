Dear Hiring Manager,
\vspace{10pt}\\
I am writing to express my interest in the Gameplay Engineer role. I recently graduated UCLA with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and believe I am a strong fit for the role. 
\vspace{6pt}\\
As a subsystem lead for a NASA funded, published satellite mission, I am experienced in a fast-paced, DevOps environment in which communication was mission critical. Responsible for crucial data products, I worked closely with clients to ensure accruracy and consistency of the date pipeline. I designed an asynchronous solution from scratch to communicate between multiple environments and languages, including Matlab, Python, SQL, and IDL. As the primary owner of my subsystem's software, I have provided testing, automation, documentation, and bugfixes throughout the mission. As a student, I collaborated with my peers on class and pet projects. These projects include: replicating ML papers, prototyping ML applications, and building a virtual tour of the body in Unity. 
\vspace{6pt}\\
In my personal time, I have enjoyed playing video games for most of my life. I recently got back into Warcraft 3 after purchasing the reforged edition; a game or two of Wintermaul Reforged is very relaxing. My other current favorite is Call of Duty: Warzone. I personally think it's the most fun Battle Royale at the moment and primarily enjoy playing duos or trios. Finally, if I have enough chaotic energy for it, Among Us is a natural choice for larger groups of people. 
\vspace{6pt}\\
Due to my technical experience and my engrained passion for gaming, I feel I am strong pick for the Gameplay Engineer role.
